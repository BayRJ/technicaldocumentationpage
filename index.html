      <h2>Introduction to Python</h2>
      <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further 
        developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers 
        to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
        Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
        There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.
        It is used for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>web development(server-side),</li>
        <li>software development,</li>
        <li>mathematics</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What can Python do?</h2>
      <p>This shows what can Python be used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
        <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
        <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="print">
      <h2>Print Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output device.
        The message can be a string, or any other object, the object will be converted into a string before written to the screen.
        This is how you display a statement using Python:</p>
      <code>print("GeeksQuiz") </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="functions">
      <h2>Functions: the Basics</h2>
      <p>In Python, defining the function works as follows. def is the keyword for defining a function. The function name is followed by parameter(s) in (). 
        The colon : signals the start of the function body, which is marked by indentation. Inside the function body, the return statement determines the 
        value to be returned. After function definition is complete, calling the function with an argument returns a value.</p>
      <code>
        >>> def f(x):
        return x**2 + 1
        >>> f(4)
        17
        >>> 
      </code>

    <section class="main-section" id="python-classes">
      <h2>What is a class?</h2>
      <p>
        A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. 
        In python a class is created by the keyword class. An object is created using the constructor of the class. 
        This object will then be called the instance of the class. In Python we create instances in the following manner
      </p>
      <code>Instance = class(arguments)</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="attributes">
      <h2>Attributes</h2>
      <p>
        A class by itself is of no use unless there is some functionality associated with it. Functionalities are defined by setting attributes, 
        which act as containers for data and functions related to those attributes. Those functions are called methods.
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> class Snake:
        ...     name = "python" # set an attribute `name` of the class
      </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="methods">
      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        Once there are attributes that “belong” to the class, you can define functions that will access the class attribute. 
        These functions are called methods. When you define methods, you will need to always provide the first argument to the method with a self keyword.
      </p>
      <code>
        >>> class Snake:
...     name = "python"
...     
...     def change_name(self, new_name): # note that the first argument is self
...         self.name = new_name # access the class attribute with the self keyword
      </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="special-methods">
      <h2>Special Methods</h2>
      <p>
        All the built-in data types implement a collection of special object methods. The names of special methods are always preceded and followed by double 
        underscores (__). These methods are automatically triggered by the interpreter as a program executes. For example, the operation x + y is mapped to an 
        internal method, x.__add__(y), and an indexing operation, x[k], is mapped to x.__getitem__(k). The behavior of each data type depends entirely on the 
        set of special methods that it implements.
      </p>
      <p>
        User-defined classes can define new objects that behave like the built-in types simply by supplying an appropriate subset of the special methods described 
        in this section. In addition, built-in types such as lists and dictionaries can be specialized (via inheritance) by redefining some of the special methods.
      </p>
      <code>__new__(cls [,*args [,**kwargs]])</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="decorators">
      <h2>Python decorators</h2>
      <p>
        In Python, a decorator is a design pattern that allows you to modify the functionality of a function by wrapping it in another function.
        The outer function is called the decorator, which takes the original function as an argument and returns a modified version of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we learn about decorators, we need to understand a few important concepts related to Python functions. 
        Also, remember that everything in Python is an object, even functions are objects.
      </p>

      <code>
        def outer(x):
          def inner(y):
            return x + y
          return inner

        add_five = outer(5)
        result = add_five(6)
        print(result)  # prints 11
      </code>
